# Library-Management-Project
Library Management project for Smartteach "FULL STACK DEVELOPER JAVA SPRING BOOT" Webinar needs some improvements.

I need to do some small adjustments to the final project because there are some inconsistensies also i want to add a reset password function but the idea is simple, I wanted to make an in-store or better yet an in-Library app where students will go to the Librarian to register them in the system and then the Students will use the tablets or the computers of the library to make orders so the Librarians will then accept or deny them.

The Librarians can create users give priviledges to them .Furthermore they will accept ,deny ,extend or delete orders, and they can enable or disable users based on due orders so that they cannot make new orders if they havent returned the books.

The student users can make orders ,download their library cards,cancel orders before those have been confirmed or delete them if they are denied.

Both Students and Librarians have notification for Due orders and because i am experementing with search functions i've used 2 different ones in users list and book list but i will choose the one i am liking best in the final product.

Also i have yet to finalize the change password method that the Librarian will have if a student loses his password. 

UPDATES SOON
